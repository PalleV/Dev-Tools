Know how for KP:
- Read from .ini-file:
 self.load_settings()
 Reads helloworld.ini
 settings.get_bool("keep_history", "main", self.DEFAULT_KEEP_HISTORY)
 under "main" in helloworld.ini, find the value "keep_history" and overwrite self.DEFAULT_KEEP_HISTORY

- on_start(self):
  called after install

- on_catalog(self):
  called after install, refresh and selecting an item

  self.set_catalog([self.create_item(
            category=kp.ItemCategory.KEYWORD,
            label="HelloWorld", <-- the label to show
            short_desc="Hello World", <-- the description
            target="hello", <-- what to write
            args_hint=kp.ItemArgsHint.REQUIRED,
            hit_hint=kp.ItemHitHint.NOARGS
        )])

- on_suggest(self):
  called on every keypress - globally!
